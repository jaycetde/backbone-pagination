backbone-pagination
========================

This is an experimental remake of [backbone-pagination](https://github.com/ptnplanet/backbone-pagination). It removes the option to use pretty URLs and focuses on query parameters.

Please refer to [backbone-pagination](https://github.com/ptnplanet/backbone-pagination) for API help.

backbone.pagination depends on backbone.fetchoptions. I will provide a combined file soon.

Fetch Options
-------------

Fetch Options provides the capability of setting the default options that are sent using collection.fetch(*options*).

Until I add more documentation, please review the source code to see how it works

How to use
----------

```html
<script src="backbone.fetchoptions.js"></script>
<script src="backbone.pagination.js"></script>
